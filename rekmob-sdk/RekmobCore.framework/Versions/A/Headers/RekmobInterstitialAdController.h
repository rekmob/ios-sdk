 * loaded interstitial has expired and is no longer eligible for display.
 *
 * If the ad was on-screen when it expired, you can expect that the ad will already have been
 * dismissed by the time this message is sent.
 *
 * Your implementation may include a call to `loadAd` to fetch a new ad, if desired.
